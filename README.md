*Topics* 

Data analysis and visualization of user movements in the school areas, in order to provides different information for related parties with certain purposes such as: For student to check if labs have enough spaces, to check information about the cafeteria, and for example for the cafeteria as well to coordinate resources for busy time. 

1) navigation service
2) community service (friends)
3) data analysis and visualization of the user movements (=big brother is watching you)
4) teaching (e-learning): how to utilize the system in the classroom?
5) a mobile game based on indoor positioning system

Questions for describing the system:

In which ways it is possible to argue and to state that you are really developing state-of-the-art solution?
How is it possible to convince and motivate your customer with the documentation?
Which parts/functionalities of the product should be mandatory and which not? Why?
How you will state you are really building a quality product?
How you will guarantee your process and team quality?
How you are able to get enough money from the customer? How much money is needed, what is enough? How to decrease the costs?
What are the main risks in your upcoming project? How would you document the risks and the solutions?



*Document structure*

###1. Cover

Title: Software Requirement Specs of iCheck position system. 
Team name: AFB (Apple Fan Boys)
Team members: Tran Dinh Thien Phuc, Luu Tuan Dung
Date: 18 Sep 2014

###2. Introduction

Inspired by the long wait, the displeasure when going to toilet and it's busy, going to coverred lab room and it's full, a position system is create in order to provide different services to students and staffs at Metropolia, for an untroubled experience, at Metropolia's facilities.

###3. Use cases

* Users groups, brief and definition:  
 * User/Visitor: not registered user, has never used the service before. The visitor the can review the service or register as a user/client or a user/service provider
 * User/Client: registered user, has all the rights as visitors, plus user can use the services offered by the system.
 * User/Service Provider: registered user, has all the rights as visitors, client, plus the ability to propose and offer services
 * Admin: system administrator, has all rights in the system, can access and manage clients and services providers' attributes. 

* Use case diagrams @luutuandungti can you add use cases here or better create a use case diagram

* Use case scenarios (based on template)
* Depiction of one use case as a flow chart

4. System architecture

High-level overview of the system
Main modules and their functions represented

5. Requirements (in traceable (and measurable) format)

Functional requirements: *Consider the privacy of users*
Non-functional system requirements
Usability: how do you ensure that your system is easy to use?
Reliability: how do you ensure that your system is reliable? List the possible system failures and how the system reacts to them
Efficiency: there are multiple people using your system. How do ensure that the system is efficient enough? What metrics would you use?
What other non-functional requirements should be documented?
What kind of metrics you should use to guarantee unambiguity?

6. User interface

What are the views / components of the system? What are the functionalities of each view?
Illustrate each view and what it is used for (Textual explanation ok, no need for pictures!)

7. Project management, self reflection

List the realized working hours, that is, how many hours did this work really take. List the hours separately per person.
Was it difficult to estimate workload, how much the estimation differed from real working hours?
What would you do differently on the next project? Was your project success, would you buy your product?
What was the most difficult part in the documentation? Is there something that you were not satisfied with?
Grading

Max points: 30 p.

+6: cover+ introduction + project management (1,2,7)
+6: use cases (3)
+6: system overview (4)
+6: requirements (5)
+6: user interface (6)

In addition, each project group will peer review their own work and contribution of each participant,
based on the review, points can be scaled up or down.

Guidelines

Focus on things that are required, keep the documentation simple and straightforward.
Take advantage of the lab hours where Patrick is present to answer you questions.
Share the workload. Work should be easy if each group member is committed to project.
If you still have problems and don't understand what to do or how to do something, you can ask a question by sending an email to Olli
