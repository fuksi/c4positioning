7. Project management, self reflection

List the realized working hours, that is, how many hours did this work really take. List the hours separately per person.
Was it difficult to estimate workload, how much the estimation differed from real working hours?
What would you do differently on the next project? Was your project success, would you buy your product?
What was the most difficult part in the documentation? Is there something that you were not satisfied with?
