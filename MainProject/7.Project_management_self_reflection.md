####7. Project management, self reflection

 * Working hours for this documentation was around a day or half a day for whole team.
Hours separately per person: Phuc 6 hours.  

 * It was difficult to estimate the workload since we have to decided the limit of the project any time since we are doing only the documentation, not the implementation of the project. Real working hours was quite a bit less than estimated the the start of 2nd year probably is busiest time of the whole degree. The product is relevant, so yes, as a stakeholder, I would buy the product. The most difficult part of the documentation is trying the list the specification of a product that you not really going to make. Then we who are making this documentation are not the stakeholder of the documentation itself, then we find it hard to get the motivation to think deeper and develop the project as well as the documentation.
