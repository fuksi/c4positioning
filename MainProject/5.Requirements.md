Functional requirements: *Consider the privacy of users*
Non-functional system requirements
Usability: how do you ensure that your system is easy to use?
Reliability: how do you ensure that your system is reliable? List the possible system failures and how the system reacts to them
Efficiency: there are multiple people using your system. How do ensure that the system is efficient enough? What metrics would you use?
What other non-functional requirements should be documented?
What kind of metrics you should use to guarantee unambiguity?
